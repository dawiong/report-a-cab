# report-a-cab [WIP]
Report a cab app made using Ionic. Just started fresh yet so functionalities are still incomplete.

## Road Map
1. Meteor Integration for backend purposes
2. ES6 Upgrade
  1. App Restructure for Bower components and Gulp tasks
  2. Babel Integration
3. Improve and check Readme
4. Pan out App Features  
...  
*More to come!*  

## Installation

1. Make sure you have `npm` installed.
2. Install `gulp`, `bower`, `cordova`, and `ionic` globally using npm, if you haven't done it already.
3. Navigate to the project folder, and run the following:
  1. `npm install` to install the dependencies and devDependencies in package.json
  2. `bower install` to install the bower dependencies
  3. `ionic state restore` to install the cordovaPlugins and platforms listed in package.json

## Running

1. Run `ionic serve` to run in a browser
